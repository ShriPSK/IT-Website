                <p>I am very much pleased about the environment in classroom. Programming Labs were well equipped and provided the needful. The application of the syllabus in real life was good enough to build my future career. The syllabus was on advanced topics and was able to achieve the learning outcomes through many tutorials and practicals.

                <p>Learning using prescribed books, resources evolves the student's knowledge. The course objectives completely reflects on to the syllabus and is well organised.
Embedded System course does not have IOT in its syllabus. If it is included, students will be able to learn and know about the updated technology. We are fortunate that we are given freedom to incorporate changes in the syllabus if necessary.</p>
