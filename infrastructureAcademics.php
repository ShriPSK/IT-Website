        <p>The computational needs of the researchers and engineers are met through well equipped laboratories. The
            resources in the department are continually updated with the changing industrial trends. The Advanced
            computing facility has been provided with the latest dual-core processors from Intel.</p>

            The department has well equipped laboratories with facilities that are vital to train the students in
            state-of-art software and hardware. As a part of our expansion initiatives, a new computer lab of about 4500
            sq.ft has been setup in the third floor of the IT department. A separate IT department block has also been
            proposed and is expected to start functioning in a couple of years.</p>
